                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-1}"> AdoptDontShop is a Bulgarian organization working to solve the stray dog and cats problem in Sofia.
                    With
                    the help of thousands of people we created our own shelter – the Farm, where 200 souls find
                    treatment
                    and care 365 days in a year. We are always open for adoptions and the shelter clinic offers free
                    spaying
                    and neutering.
                </p>
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-2}" >
                    We strive to find good and responsible owners for the dogs and cats place at our care. We seek homes
                    for
                    them both in Bulgaria and abroad. We re-home approx. 70 dogs every month.
                </p>
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-3}">
                    We do our best to respond to any signals about dogs and cats in distress but our resources are very
                    limited at times. We take on injured and abused animals nearly every day.
                </p>

                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-4}" >
                    We apply the catch-neuter-return method as we believe this is the only humane and legal way to
                    curtail the stray dog population successfully.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12 align-items-center">

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-5}" > We started our work as volunteers in the municipal pound of Seslavtzi (with a capacity of about 200
                    dogs). When a rumor was spread that the municipality is planning to open a new pound with a capacity
                    of 500 animals, we were shocked. How were we to cope – to take animals to foster homes for
                    treatment, to vaccinate, to find owners? How could we be useful to so many fogs, making time for
                    them away from work? And then a wise person told us: “If you want to be helping the dogs, you need
                    to be where they are. Not at home. Not at work. But at the shelter”
                </p>
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-6}">
                    And so, the newly- created organization took over the management of the newly-opened municipal
                    pound. And it became the very first place to admit hundreds of volunteers, a place where people
                    would bring their kids in the weekends. Thanks to our volunteers and donors, everyone in Bulgaria
                    learnt that homeless animal shelters can be different, and helping animals in need is not just
                    possible, but also pleasant. And that changed not just the Bogrov shelter, but also the other
                    shelters and organizations, but most of all – it changed the way the media and society saw the stray
                    animal problem…

                    we’ve managed to re-home about 850 dogs every year!</p>
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-8}" >In order for the chosen dogs to reach our partners in Austria, Holland and Germany, we send our dog
                    van on journeys several times a month.</p>
                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-9}" >Our dogs wait for for their local adopters at the shelter. And whilst we fight to make adoptions more
                    popular, we also look for homes for our animals abroad.</p>

                <p th:text="#{about-page-p-10}">The thousands of dogs we placed in homes from the streets of Sofia are a very serious percent of the
                    total decrease of stray dog numbers in the city. And we are proud of our good work!</p>
