about-page-p-1=AdoptDontShop is a Bulgarian organization working to solve the stray dog and cats problem in Sofia. With the help of thousands of people we created our own shelter – the Farm, where 200 souls find treatment and care 365 days in a year. We are always open for adoptions and the shelter clinic offers free spaying and neutering.
about-page-p-2=We strive to find good and responsible owners for the dogs and cats place at our care. We seek homes for them both in Bulgaria and abroad. We re-home approx. 70 dogs every month.
about-page-p-3=We do our best to respond to any signals about dogs and cats in distress but our resources are very limited at times. We take on injured and abused animals nearly every day.
about-page-p-4=We apply the catch-neuter-return method as we believe this is the only humane and legal way to curtail the stray dog population successfully.
about-page-p-5=We started our work as volunteers in the municipal pound of Seslavtzi (with a capacity of about 200 dogs). When a rumor was spread that the municipality is planning to open a new pound with a capacity of 500 animals, we were shocked. How were we to cope – to take animals to foster homes for treatment, to vaccinate, to find owners? How could we be useful to so many fogs, making time for them away from work? And then a wise person told us: “If you want to be helping the dogs, you need to be where they are. Not at home. Not at work. But at the shelter”. 
about-page-p-6=And so, the newly- created organization took over the management of the newly-opened municipal pound. And it became the very first place to admit hundreds of volunteers, a place where people would bring their kids in the weekends. Thanks to our volunteers and donors, everyone in Bulgaria learnt that homeless animal shelters can be different, and helping animals in need is not just possible, but also pleasant. And that changed not just the Bogrov shelter, but also the other shelters and organizations, but most of all – it changed the way the media and society saw the stray animal problem… 
about-page-p-7=Although we are very particular with candidates for adoption and do not give away dogs to everyone, we’ve managed to re-home about 850 dogs every year!
about-page-p-8=In order for the chosen dogs to reach our partners in Austria, Holland and Germany, we send our dog van on journeys several times a month.
about-page-p-9=Our dogs wait for for their local adopters at the shelter. And whilst we fight to make adoptions more popular, we also look for homes for our animals abroad.
about-page-p-10=The thousands of dogs we placed in homes from the streets of Sofia are a very serious percent of the total decrease of stray dog numbers in the city. And we are proud of our good work!
